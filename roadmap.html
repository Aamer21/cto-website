  </p>

  <p>We are modernizing GSA IT by first setting up the CTO office with modern design, development, and project management methods.  This is happening through foundational projects (e.g., building websites, creating new strategies, organizing around Agile) and projects supporting various GSA IT divisions (e.g., document management, National Staffing Application, LiSaaS).  In some cases, it involves working with outside GSA organziations (OSTP/OCSIT Challenge Toolkit, TTS stand-up, open-source with D2D).</p>

  <p>This roadmap sets our priorities for the year and provides information for our stakeholders.  This roadmap is a rough estimate of what we're focused on completing in the near, medium, and long-term.</p>

  <p>The items in the roadmap are subject to change; we'll do our best to keep the roadmap updated as things change.</p>
