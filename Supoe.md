This is a template for writing a Guide. To get started:

1. Make a copy of this template file and name it something resembling the
   title of your Guide. Use lower case and underscores instead of spaces. The
   file extension should be 'md'. Example: doing_agile_well.md

2. At the top of this file, you will want to specify the following items:
    - title: The title of this guide
    - category: Choose only one category from the list, deleting the rest

3. Delete this instructional text and replace it with your actual guide.

4. Use Markdown in writing your guide. Here are some resources on learning
   Markdown:
    - https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ - a reference
      guide
    - http://www.markdowntutorial.com/ - a more comprehensive tutorial

We recommend using the following format for your guide:

### Introduction

In the first section, introduce the guide. Offer a high-level explanation of
what it is for and how it will benefit the reader.

### This is a third-level heading

Break up the major themes of your guide into sections. This makes the guide
easier to skim.

By the way, don't use a first-level (#) or second-level (##) heading. The
website automatically creates first-level and second-level headings based on the
guide title.

#### This is a fourth-level heading

You can break down your content into fourth-level sections.

### Another third-level heading

### Measures of Success in an Agile Organization
Successful product / project delivery requires a framework and processes that embrace new and responsive ways of completing work and driving collaboration in order for the organization to thrive in this fast-paced world. For many organizations, an Agile transformation decision is driven by high-level objectives such as, increased efficiency, quick implementation to gain faster return on investment, or building the right / quality products to satisfy customers. One of the most common [challenges in these Agile organizations](https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/Agile_Adoption_Challenges_and_Best_Practices/) is the pressure to follow legacy measures and metrics to determine if new processes are achieving the desired results. Traditional metrics (e.g. fixed scope) that evaluate progress by meeting predetermined requirements and scheduled delivery, regardless of potentially evolving customer needs, fall short in effectively assessing the organization's delivery performance against its set objectives. 
In order to track and measure if the organization is making progress, redefining what is considered “success” against the new organizational values and objectives becomes an important step. Implementing new success factors and metrics that support Agile values and the customer need  become the cornerstones of defining successful delivery.  So how can an organization that has envisioned Agile benefits and set desired outcomes measure success against the same? 

### Measuring Business Value
Below are some examples of measures and metrics that could be used to facilitate and track approaches to evaluate Agile success in light of organizational values.


| Business Value                                                                           | Example Metrics                                                                                                        | Measurement Examples                                                                           |   
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customers /  stakeholders engagement                                                     | Projects implemented have  approaches to ENGAGE customers                                                              | Focus groups, User persona  development sessions,  Wireframing and sprint demo, feedback, etc. |   
| User representation  throughout the delivery process                                     | Projects have approaches  implemented to ASSESS customer satisfaction % of projects that have committed Product Owners | Delivery meets agreed-upon  high priority items / success criteria                             |   
| Continuous prioritization  and communication  of user needs and responsiveness to change | Customer satisfaction against  product / service delivered  increased by %                                             | Number of feedback loops,  ongoing communication, |


### Measuring Improved Efficiency / Productivity
One of the primary benefits of adopting Agile frameworks is enhanced process improvement through a greater emphasis on [continuous communication, collaboration, transparency](https://tech.gsa.gov/guides/visibility_and_status/) and shared responsibilities. The result is improved productivity, efficiency, and increased performance which can be measured by tracking progress made against the reduced amount of time it takes for a product / service to reach the market in addition to the improvement in quality of delivery. Organizations can eliminate duplicative handoffs across cross-functional roles and systems, align budgeting and investment funding based on performance, and significantly reduce waste and time-to-market for a given product / project  or service. Below are examples of relevant metrics that will enable to track progress against this Agile milestone:

| Organizational  Productivity | Metrics                                                                                                                                     | Measurement Examples                                                                                                                            |
