   - firstname/lastname: Your name as you want it displayed on the team page
   - photo: Filename of the photo you just added to the /img/team/ directory (if
     you don't want a photo, leave blank)
   - role: Your job title or role
   - group: Your group name within the Office of the CTO (something like
     Solutions Strategy or Digital Service)
