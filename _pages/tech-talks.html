  <h3>GSA Digital Services - <span class="usa-label">New</span></h3>
  <h5>3/14/17</h5>
  
  <p>
    Technology in the federal sector is rapidly changing with focus on new technologies to meet emerging customer and end user needs.  Design elicitation, rapid and continuous software deployments, open source technologies, sprint management cycles, etc., are the new norm.  This requires a new digital approach to IT in GSA.

  <p>
    In 2016, GSA IT established the Digital Services Division within the Office of the CTO focusing on modern design, development, and product/project management.

  <p>
    Joe Castle leads the office and will provide a Tech Talk explaining how GSA Digital Service started, its focus, and current projects.  Furthermore, he will explain how to engage the division for assistance with your current and future projects.
