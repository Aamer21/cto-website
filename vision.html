	<h2>A Technology Vision for the GSA</h2>
	<p>This vision encompasses a transformation of GSA IT towards adopting modern IT practices and providing guidance and support across the organization to be successful in that transformation.</p>

    <h3><b>Vision Statement #1: Share and Commodify Technology</b></h3>
		<p>GSA IT consolidated its organization and is moving towards <b>shared technology</b>. Currently, each business line has its own separate technology stacks with many different requirements at the edges but generally does not differ in underlying infrastructure and commodity capabilities. Realizing the benefits of being <b>one GSA IT</b> means transforming those stacks to shared technology. This means <b>identifying a service model for shared platforms</b>, aligning that to a business architecture, and understanding roles, costs, and expectations. This allows services to be “sold” internally as commodity, so IT’s value to business is more clear and our division of capabilities are well-defined.</p>

		<h3><b>Vision Statement #2: Make Small Bets</b></h3>
		<p>Traditionally, investment requests span multiple years and millions of dollars. The new Agile IT investment templates and approach to <b>smaller implementations</b> provide a focus on constructing <b>proofs-of-concepts and prototypes</b> before scaling to the final implementation. The alignment to shared services allows us to use key elements of the technology stack to reduce project startup costs. The Agile IT process will expand further into the investment process. This dramatically reduces risk by <b>aligning business and IT expectations</b> and allows for greater flexibility in our technological implementation.</p>

		<h3><b>Vision Statement #3: Modernize and Innovate with Technology</b></h3>
		<p><p>The GSA is one of the foremost technological adopters in the federal government; we are looked to as the <b>first mover of technology</b>. In order to successfully do so, the agency needs to explore new technologies while also <b>exiting outdated technologies</b>. This includes identifying expensive, difficult-to-maintain technology while moving towards more open architectures.  The technology transformation supports business services built around <b>business capabilities that are continuously delivered</b> and that are easy to replace when no longer needed. Separating from legacy technology and <b>moving to API-driven, data-centric implementations</b> provides improved, cheaper user experiences and better management of security.</p>

		<h3><b>Vision Statement #4: Be Open</b></h3>
		<p><p>There are multiple OMB policies mandating agencies to be more “open” including <b>Open Data/APIs and Open Source</b>, GSA should demonstrate leadership across the government by being aggressive in a transition towards opening its information assets; this includes opening our code, data sets and APIs as a matter of public good. Good APIs will allow for an <b>ecosystem of external and internal applications</b> that will provide and support citizen and government reuse of data and functionality.</p>

		<h3><b>Vision Statement #5: Users Come First</b></h3>
		<p><p>A primary failure of IT system development is a lack of <b>user engagement throughout implementation</b>. Through the incorporation of Agile Investment, Agile project management, and DevOps implementations, we can ensure that <b>users have direct impact on products</b> as they are <b>continuously delivered</b> to them. User experience should be insourced into the GSA so the agency itself can have internal skill sets in this area. Further, we need to continue the concept of <b>mobile availability</b> of GSA services for its employees, partners and customers.</p>
