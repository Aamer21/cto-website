Organizations in the 21st century face great opportunities and threats presented by fast paced technological advances. According to Forbes Magazine, the most [defining traits of a successful 21st century organization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gapinternational/2014/09/03/the-six-defining-traits-of-the-successful-21st-century-organization/#f2e3ddf1c600) are <b>relentless innovation</b> - requires a new mindset that liberates everyone in the organization to innovate regardless of position or function, and breakthrough <b>performance environments</b> that are flexible enough to support rapid movement, speedy decision-making and process alignment to regularly achieve extraordinary outcomes. When long rooted processes start to fail and the need for such lean delivery becomes more evident, <i>change</i> becomes a question of <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i> it can be implemented to realize the desired results with just the right amount of disruption. 

In federal environment, where there are multiple customers being served and where the room for error is minimal -  it is imperative to define and communicate the drive behind the change and the direction for a new approach before the organization can embark upon the journey of uprooting and transforming embedded delivery processes. Further, it is vital to find a starting point where the initial activities are not overwhelming for those who are championing the change.

If you are part of a change initiative and looking to develop your own approach for giving structure to starting such a difficult process of organizational change, below are some of the most effective approaches to get started.

###Step 1. Demand a Vision for Your Team

All change leaders and contributors need a relevant purpose for why they should commit the time and effort to make significant changes in the way they work. This vision provides a clear picture for individual contributors to visualize the opportunities created after the change and how their efforts now, will pay-off in the long run. On the contrary, the lack of such purpose, adversely affects the motivation for individual contributors, thus resulting in a high likelihood of abandonment during the transition. To this end, investing in time and resources to define and communicate the vision and strategy behind a change initiative is the most essential factor to secure buy-in and commitment to kick-off and support the initiative to success.
