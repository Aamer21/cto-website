|If the team’s work doesn’t get completed in a sprint, what would you do?| {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Push unfinished work to the next sprint be re-prioritized against other backlog items. </li> <li> Understanding that unfinished work within this timebox is usually a symptom of other issues, such as, change in scope, reduced capacity after sprint planning, poor estimation, etc. and the SM plans to help the team reflect  and surface the issue and address them as part of their </li> <li> Does NOT increase the length of that sprint as it is a time-box the team agreed to respect and commit to. retrospectives for continuous improvement. </li></ul> {:/}|
|What is your experience with reporting and metrics?| {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Ability to understand and clarify objectives for each metrics report. Basic understanding of Agile Metrics, such as, percentage of tasks completed, percentage of work accepted, Story Cycle Time, Defect Density, code coverage, team velocity, etc.) </li> <li> Ability to explain the difference between a BurnUp and a BurnDown </li> <li> A basic understanding of tools used to develop and deliver such metrics - the use of a scrum board</li><li> Reporting dashboards and tools (JIRA, VersionOne, etc.) </li></ul> {:/}|

The Scrum Product Owner is the primary project key stakeholder. The main role of the product owner is to have a vision of what needs to be built, and convey that vision to the scrum team. The Product Owner is the lead champion of the product and is responsible for ensuring the product creates value for its customers and users as well as the company providing it. The agile product owner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product.

|What is the difference between a Product Backlog and a Project Backlog?| {::nomarkdown}<ul><li> <b>Product Backlog:</b> evolves throughout the product lifecycle. Requirements will be added, removed and prioritized on an ongoing basis so long as the product is still in maintained. </li> <li> <b>Project backlog:</b> A project backlog is about the creation of an item with limited or scoped for delivery. When that feature/objective is met, the project is done. It is limited to the scope of the project. </li></ul>{:/}|

</li><li> Plans to regularly review and adjust the roadmap </li></ul>{:/}|

|How do you manage changing / new requirements?| Planning to employ Agile approaches to managing changes in requirements, such as: {::nomarkdown}<ul><li> Implements / follows a process that allows for feedback and changes to flow through the PO. </li> <li>  Determines the scope of the change and the scope of incorporating the change </li> <li>  Implements / follows a formal change approval process to gain approval or rejection of the change </li><li>uses the agile framework e.g. product backlogs and sprints to communicate and implement approved change requests, and keeps change logs in a shared / visible platform. </li></ul>{:/}|
