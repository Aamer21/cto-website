# How to use this Guide template

This is a template for writing a Guide. To get started:

1. Make a copy of this template file and name it something resembling the
   title of your Guide. Use lower case and underscores instead of spaces. The
   file extension should be 'md'. Example: doing_agile_well.md

2. At the top of this file, you will want to specify the following items:
    - title: The title of this guide
    - category: Choose only one category from the list, deleting the rest
    - audiences: Choose all appropriate audiences, deleting the rest

3. Delete this instructional section and replace it with your actual guide.

4. Use Markdown in writing your guide. Here are some resources on learning
   Markdown:
    - https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ - a reference
      guide
    - http://www.markdowntutorial.com/ - a more comprehensive tutorial

We recommend using the following format for your guide:

# Introduction

In this section, introduce the guide. Offer a high-level explanation of what it
is for and how it will benefit the reader.

# This is a first-level heading

Break up the major themes of your guide into sections. This makes the guide
easier to skim.

## This is a second-level heading

You can also break down your content further into second-level sections.

### This is a third-level heading

And third-level sections...

#### This is a fourth-level heading

And fourth-level sections...

# Another first-level heading
