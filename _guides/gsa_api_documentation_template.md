This is the place to look for notes on participating with GSA's API-first strategy.  The framework is an open source template that business/IT offices can use to assist with documentation of RESTful APIs.  It is a template the can be forked, changed, and posted for support of API consumption.  It outlines a process for an individual creating an API and an indivdual wanting to consume an API.

This a documentation template for GSA APIs provided by GSA Digital Services to provide a consistent look and feel for GSA APIs. It is based on excellent work from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and GSA's 18F organization, along with best practices in private industry.
