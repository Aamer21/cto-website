This is the place to look for notes on participating with GSA's API-first strategy.  The framework is an open source template that business/IT offices can use to assist with documentation of RESTful APIs.  It is a template the can be forked, changed, and posted for support of API consumption.  It outlines a process for an individual creating an API and an indivdual wanting to consume an API.
