### How are visibility and status communicated differently?
Visibility provides **transparency** into the development process. It is the ability to see progress at any point and determine the distance to completion (of a goal). Visibility provides **status** of not only the progress of the project, but the product itself.

In an Agile environment, **visibility** is not only privy to key stakeholders, but also end users as they engage in a continuous cycle of feedback, acceptance testing, and iteration demos. Insight into the development process enables “Responding to change over following a plan” (Agile Manifesto) and is inherent to most Agile frameworks, like Scrum, Kanban, etc.
