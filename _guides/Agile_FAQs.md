          <div id="question-1" class="usa-accordion-content">
            <p>Agile is considered an alternative approach to traditional project management or product development. It is a value-based, iterative approach under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. 

Although it rose out of software development practices, Agile is not a software-development framework. It is neither methodological nor prescriptive; there is no exact way to become Agile. Also, Agile is not synonymous with Scrum (or Kanban, TDD, etc.) or a specific tool (i.e. JIRA, Rally, etc.).

The term agile was first coined for this in 2001, in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development (Agile Manifesto) and although originally written as Agile (with a capital A) this is progressively becoming deprecated. 

Success in Agile is based on an attitude of “servant leadership” and focuses on the team, not just developers. Agile encourages and does not lack in accountability or ownership. As a solution for complex problems, teams must “be” Agile, not just “do” Agile.</p>

          What is the Agile Manifesto?
          </button>
          <div id="question-2" class="usa-accordion-content">
            <p>The Agile Manifesto was written in February of 2001 by seventeen independent-minded software practitioners . The participants found consensus around four main values [below] that makeup the Agile manifesto.</p> 
<p><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over <b>processes and tools</b>. Agile is more about transparent interactions than technology.</p>

<p><b>Working software</b> over <b>comprehensive documentation</b>. Create something usable quickly to enable faster customer feedback.</p> 

<p><b>Customer collaboration</b> over <b>contract negotiation</b>. Ensure customer buy-in between Business & IT, with marketable visibility.</p>

<p><b>Responding to change</b> over <b>following a plan</b>. Leave room for emergent solutions and better respond to change</p>

            What are the Principles of Agile?
          </button>
          <div id="question-1" class="usa-accordion-content">
            <p> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</p>
            <p> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</p>
            <p> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
            <p> 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</p>
            <p> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</p>
            <p> 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</p>
            <p> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. </p>
            <p> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
            <p> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</p>
            <p> 10. Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.</p>
            <p> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</p>
            <p> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>

            What are the most common Agile methodologies?

          <div id="question-2" class="usa-accordion-content">
            <p><b> Scrum </b></p>
            <p> A framework for the iterative development of complex products, particularly software. Scrum is the most widely recognized Agile framework, and is compatible with other Agile practices like Extreme Programming. Scrum is comprised of a series of short iterations – called sprints – each of which ends with the delivery of an increment of working software.</p>
            <p> <b> The framework is comprised of three roles: </b> </p> 
<p>Product Owner,</p> 
<p>ScrumMaster, </p>
<p>(Scrum) Team</p>
<p><b>Four Ceremonies:</b></p> 
<p>Daily Standup Meeting,</p> 
<p> Sprint Planning Meeting,</p> 
<p> Sprint Review,</p>
<p> Retrospective</p>
<p><b>Three artifacts: </b> </p>
<p> Burndown charts,</p> 
<p> Product backlog,</p> 
<p> Sprint backlog</p>
<p> Scrum should not be used interchangeably with the term Agile. Agile is not a framework, but a broader set of values and practices, while Scrum is a specific framework that fits comfortably under the Agile umbrella. </p>
