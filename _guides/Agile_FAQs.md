          <div id="question-1" class="usa-accordion-content">
            <p>Agile is considered an alternative approach to traditional project management or product development. It is a value-based, iterative approach under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. 

Although it rose out of software development practices, Agile is not a software-development framework. It is neither methodological nor prescriptive; there is no exact way to become Agile. Also, Agile is not synonymous with Scrum (or Kanban, TDD, etc.) or a specific tool (i.e. JIRA, Rally, etc.).

The term agile was first coined for this in 2001, in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development (Agile Manifesto) and although originally written as Agile (with a capital A) this is progressively becoming deprecated. 

Success in Agile is based on an attitude of “servant leadership” and focuses on the team, not just developers. Agile encourages and does not lack in accountability or ownership. As a solution for complex problems, teams must “be” Agile, not just “do” Agile.</p>

          What is the Agile Manifesto?

          <div id="question-2" class="usa-accordion-content">
            <p>The Agile Manifesto was written in February of 2001 by seventeen independent-minded software practitioners . The participants found consensus around four main values [below] that makeup the Agile manifesto.</p> 
<p><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over <b>processes and tools</b>. Agile is more about transparent interactions than technology.</p>

<p><b>Working software</b> over <b>comprehensive documentation</b>. Create something usable quickly to enable faster customer feedback.</p> 

<p><b>Customer collaboration</b> over <b>contract negotiation</b>. Ensure customer buy-in between Business & IT, with marketable visibility.</p>

<p><b>Responding to change</b> over <b>following a plan</b>. Leave room for emergent solutions and better respond to change</p>
