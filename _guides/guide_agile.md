Are you new to Agile? Trying to understand how this approach to project management differs from more traditional methods? Wondering how this will affect projects at the General Services Administration (GSA)? The CTO Team and [TECH.GSA.GOV](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/) can help! This guide will direct you through the content and resources we offer regarding Agile adoption.

### Understanding Agile
Agile is not a process, methodology, or a specific tool. Agile is a mindset. The Agile Manifesto fully details the [values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/) that comprise Agile behavior, which we summarize in [Agile Adoption at GSA](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/agile_adoption_gsa/). It also includes some common terminology, an introduction to the benefits of Agile culture, and behaviors we can adapt to becoming more Agile.

In [Popular Approaches to Agile Adoption](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/popular_approaches/), we highlight the most notable Agile frameworks [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) and [Kanban](https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/what-is-kanban/), and discuss their values, common terms, roles, ceremonies, and how teams can get started with each approach. However, Agile adoption is not always an easy transition; shifting the mindset of an organization and its people can present many challenges. [Agile Adoption Challenges and Best Practices](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/Agile_Adoption_Challenges_and_Best-_Practices/) features some of the major challenges to Agile adoption and recommends various mitigation techniques.

Despite the challenges, the benefits of an Agile environment can far outweigh the growing pains, as introduced in Agile Adoption at GSA. [Visibility & Status in an Agile Environment](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/visibility_and_status/) further discusses how creating an Agile environment can better support transparency, visibility, communication, and accountability.

### Implementing Agile at the Organizational Level
The success of an Agile implementation begins “at the top” - it requires the full support of executive and managerial leadership. The GSA provides support of Agile adoption through Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). As part of the GSA IT vision, we have committed to building a supportive environment for iterative and open-source development. The [U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/digital_services_playbook/) and [18F: Agile Principles and Practices](https://pages.18f.gov/agile/) outline the practices that have been put in place to support Agile and iterative development environment by the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The CTO Office continues to champion Agile adoption through the Agile Investment Process as described in the [Agile Investment Overview](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/agile_investment_overview/). It illustrates the five-phased approach to piloting potential IT investments, its benefits, and its collaborative partners across GSA IT and Business groups. [Taking an Agile Investment Approach](https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/GSA/cto-website/dev/guides/agile_pilot_teams/) extends the discussion into the needs for a successful pilot, including the supporting Scrum roles and ceremonies. 

*The expectations and outputs for concepts submitted through the Agile Investment process are outlined in the Discovery Phase Checklist and Proof Of Concept (PoC) Phase Checklist.

### Implementing Agile at the Project / Product Level
Agile adoption at the organizational level creates a transparent, responsive, and flexible environment that is readily able to handle change in the market. However, we recognize that not every project or product will benefit from an Agile approach; those that do are typically large and complex in nature. 

The CTO Team provides Agile coaching, resources, and guidance in the Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps approaches. Regardless of the framework used, Conducting an Agile Project focuses on iterative development; we can guide you through Managing Requirements in an Agile Environment, Defining When a Requirement is Complete, Writing Effective User Stories, Estimation & Story Pointing, and facilitating successful Agile Meetings Goals and Benefits.

*For frequently-asked, high-level questions regarding Agile, check out the Agile FAQ. For various terminology used throughout the content, the Agile Glossary provides an up-to-date reference. Additionally, most content offers sources or a “Good Reads” section that includes reference information.
