New CTO team members will want to consider the following when onboarding:

1. Pick-up ID card (PIV card), receive pre-ordered GSA laptop, should receive GSA ENT login (for GMail, GSA systems)
2. Login to the laptop with PIV card to establish credentials (must be on a GSA network)
3. Setup GitHub account - follow GSA's [implementation and administration of github.com/gsa](https://github.com/GSA/GitHub-Administration) and 18F's [Open Source Style Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/)
4. Look at approved SW list (forthcoming on CTO site) if additional SW is needed on GFE
5. Setup telework capabilities on GFE - VPN and [Horizon](https://horizon.gsa.gov/)
5. Establish travel account in Concur and obtain travel card
6. Look over process guides for travel, training, conferences, etc. (forthcoming on CTO site)
