Return to Agile Meetings (anchor link)

A common misconception about Agile projects is that they lack planning and documentation when conversely, planning in Agile projects occurs continuously throughout each sprint. Additionally, when kicking off a new Agile project, it too requires preparation and supporting documentation for sign-off. Any information that will ensure all team members, subject matter experts (SMEs), key stakeholders, and sponsors are on the same page in terms of the goals to be achieved and the criteria by which success will be measured - should be incorporated. Moreover, to ensure a successful start to the Agile project, a well-prepared kick-off meeting is a must.

### Agile Project Kick-off Agenda

The Agile Project Kick-off agenda should convey the high-level project overview and overarching strategy, project vision and scope, team roles and responsibilities, as well as the Agile approach and supporting ceremonies to be used. At the end of the kick-off meeting, the team should have an action plan for next steps.

_If **any** of the team members, SMEs, key stakeholders, and sponsors are unfamiliar with Agile or the approach, time should be allotted for a light introduction and plans made to provide formalized (group) training of team members at a later date._

The following information should be covered during the Agile Project Kick-off:

### Sprint 0 Session

Further, as either an extension of the Agile Project Kick-off, or as a scheduled separate meeting to kick off the teamâ€™s effort, the Sprint 0 session should focus on the needs of the Team. Other attendees can be relieved or the Scrum Master can schedule the separate session with the Product Owner and team members. The following information should be covered during the Sprint 0 Session:
