### Scrum Meetings, AKA Ceremonies

**The Sprint Planning Meeting** 

| **Purpose:** 
To define a realistic Sprint goal and backlog containing all items that could be fully implemented until the end of the Sprint by the Scrum team. The sprint planning meeting results in two Scrum Artifacts, the Spring goal and Sprint backlog. |

| **Who should attend:** 

The Product Owner, ScrumMaster and the entire Scrum Team. |

| **How it is conducted:**  
* The Product Owner defines the Sprint Goal - a short description of what the sprint will attempt to achieve, clarifies the details on backlog items and their respective acceptance criteria
* These entries are updated and broken into smaller stories by the team so that they can be completed within one Sprint.
* The stories are estimated, prioritized and tasked.
* The Scrum Team defines their capacity for the upcoming Sprint - the total capacity of the Scrum Team might change from Sprint to Sprint. In order to come to realistic commitments it is necessary to know the total capacity of the team for the upcoming Sprint considering e.g. vacations, public holidays, efforts for Scrum Meetings and time needed for other activities during the Sprint.
* Tasks are taken up by the team members based on their experience levels and expertise
* The team is ready to start with the daily sprints. |

| **Useful Tips:**
* Timebox the meeting. And stop when you reach that time. 
* Make sure the Product Owner has the Product Backlog prioritized and ready before the meeting. Use the Definition of Ready (DOR), i.e. only work with stories that are ‘Ready
* Review and agree on the acceptance criteria and when a given work is considered ‘done’ (use a Definition of Done)
* The Scrum Team selects how much work they can do in the coming sprint based on their capacity (not influenced by the Product Owner).
* Ensure the team asks questions to the Product Owner and stakeholders on unclear requirements. 
* Plan for collaboration of team members and NOT for optimal ‘resource utilization’ or try to be over efficient with everybody’s time. |

| **Benefits:** Below are some of the benefits of running a successful Sprint Planning meeting: 
* Enables the Team to agree on the sprint goal and commitment 
* Creates the platform to communicate dependencies and identify team capacity to set and commit to an achievable sprint goal.
* Ensures that daily sprints remain productive. |


**The Daily Scrum / Stand-up** 

| **Purpose:** 
To provide a platform for a Scrum team to get together and review progress toward their Sprint goal and assess any risks to their Sprint commitment. |

| **Who should attend:** 

The ScrumMaster and the entire Scrum team, Product Owner (optional), and Outside stakeholders may attend by invitation of the team |

| **How it is conducted:**  
* During the daily scrum, each team member answers the following three questions:
  * What did the team do yesterday?
    What will the team do today?
    Are there any impediments in the way? *
* By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today, the team gains an understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. |

| **Useful Tips:**
* The daily stand-up should be time-boxed
* Should be held at the same place or location and time every day
* Each member of the team should participate, and own/share responsibility of the full sprint backlog 
* The ScrumMaster facilitates  regular daily meeting times. 
* Don't update the sprint backlog during this meeting. 
* The goal should be to resolve impediments. 
* Ensure that each team member remains present till the end of the meeting. 
* Make sure it is understood this meeting is not a status update meeting in which a boss is collecting information about who is on schedule or behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other. |

| **Benefits:** Below are some of the benefits of running a successful Sprint daily Scrum meeting: 
* Enables the team to be in sync on how things are going
* Allows for identification and solution of impediments 
* Provides an opportunity for small course corrections within the sprint
* Building trust between team members 
* High visibility of progress
* Promotes self-organization in team: team members hold each other accountable for achieving their daily commitments |
