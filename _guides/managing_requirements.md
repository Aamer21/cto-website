In many ways, the manner of capturing requirements in an Agile project management environment is similar to a “waterfall,” or traditional project management environment - numerous meetings with subject matter experts, end users, walkthrough / documenting the current business workflow, creating mockups, etc. However, Agile and traditional project management approaches contrast in how requirements are managed over time.

Some fundamental differences in managing requirements include:

| Traditional Requirements Management | Agile Requirements Management |
| In a “waterfall” project management environment, the approach is to capture and define all of the end-state requirements upfront. | *Promote sustainable development* |
| *Deliver working software frequently* | *Continuous attention to technical excellence* |
| *Business people and developers must work together daily* | *Maximize amount of work not done* |
| *Build projects around motivated individuals* | *Self-organizing teams* |
| *Face-to-face conversation* | *Reflect...and tune* |

“Managing” requirements in an Agile project management environment is to think through the full life cycle of the requirement; to consider the full user experience and even beyond the defined stakeholders. Business requirements should be broken down in such a way that supports iterative development and enables flexibility to respond to potential changes as each increment is delivered and reviewed by business users and / or customers. Further, they should produce strong, testable user stories that are clarified and reviewed often with the customer, end users, and development. Requirements, or user stories, should also promote a consistent conversation with the team. Those conversations also lead to a better understanding of requirements, resulting in a more informed estimation and prioritization. As both the business users and the development team are engaged throughout the project, it builds trust across the board. Finally, it ensures faster, better delivery of requirements that truly convey and meet the business need.
