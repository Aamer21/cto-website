"User experience design most frequently defines a sequence of interactions between a user (individual person) and a system, virtual or physical, designed to meet or support user needs and goals, primarily, while also satisfying systems requirements and organizational objectives ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design))."

UX Designers focus on meeting with the end users and trying to understand the world through the user's eyes as they wish to interact with a system.  The CTO's office has largely been using UX Design to create [personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) and [wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) although there are many more ways to get to end user needs (see [18F's design methods](https://methods.18f.gov/)).

As we mature our Digital Service and modern development practices, we will continue to add more content here with instructions on how to carry-out UX design in the organization.  No doubt a much needed service to address end user needs and the representations of such needs with front-end development.
